00:00:23.19	- 00:00:24.39 
Father?

00:00:24.49	- 00:00:26.95	
Is it... over?

00:00:27.48	- 00:00:29.97	
At long last.

00:00:30.42	- 00:00:35.48	
No king rules forever, my son.
	
00:00:35.71	- 00:00:43.65	
I see... only darkness... before me...
	
00:01:00.42	- 00:01:01.84	
Without its master's command,

00:01:01.98	- 00:01:05.89	
the restless Scourge will become an even greater threat to this world.
	
00:01:09.18	- 00:01:12.18	
Control must be maintained...

00:01:12.64	- 00:01:15.61	
There must always be...

00:01:15.65	- 00:01:19.32	
a Lich King...

00:01:43.61	- 00:01:47.52	
The weight of such a burden...

00:01:47.56	- 00:01:49.38	
... It must be mine,

00:01:50.11	- 00:01:50.65	
for there is no other to--

00:01:50.85	- 00:01:51.84	
Tirion...

00:01:52.93	- 00:01:55.85	
You hold a grim destiny in your hands, brother
	
00:01:56.39	- 00:02:00.45	
... but it is not your own.

00:02:01.10	- 00:02:01.75	
Bolvar...

00:02:02.16	- 00:02:04.40	
By all that's holy...

00:02:05.40	- 00:02:11.21	
The dragons' flame... sealed my fate...

00:02:12.08	- 00:02:16.11	
The world of the living can no longer comfort me.

00:02:21.08	- 00:02:23.29	
Place the crown upon my head, Tirion.

00:02:23.79	- 00:02:28.40	
Forevermore - I will be the jailor of the damned.

00:02:28.44	- 00:02:30.64	
NO, old friend... I cannot...

00:02:30.68	- 00:02:32.34	
DO IT, TIRION!

00:02:32.59	- 00:02:37.42	
You and these brave heroes have your own destinies to fulfill.

00:02:38.38	- 00:02:42.75	
This last act of service... is mine.

00:02:51.72	- 00:02:54.49	
You will not be forgotten... brother.

00:02:57.02	- 00:02:59.26	
I MUST be forgotten, Tirion!

00:02:59.30	- 00:03:05.51	
If the world is to live free from the tyranny of fear - they must never know what was done here today.

00:03:24.79	- 00:03:27.97	
Tell them only that the Lich King is dead...

00:03:28.31	- 00:03:32.92	
and that Bolvar Fordragon died with him...

00:03:38.20	- 00:03:39.21	
NOW GO.

00:03:40.29	- 00:03:45.45	
LEAVE THIS PLACE - AND NEVER RETURN.
