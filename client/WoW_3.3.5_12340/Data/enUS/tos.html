</p><br/><p>
9. Code of Conduct. As with all things&#44; your use of the Game and the Service is governed by certain rules. These rules (the &#34;Code of Conduct&#34;)&#44; maintained and enforced exclusively by Blizzard&#44; must be adhered to by all users. It is your responsibility to know&#44; understand and abide by this Code of Conduct. The following rules are not meant to be exhaustive&#44; and Blizzard reserves the right to determine which conduct it considers to be outside the spirit of the Game and to take such disciplinary measures as it sees fit up to and including termination and deletion of the Account. Blizzard reserves the right to modify this Code of Conduct at any time.
<br/>

<br/>
A. Rules Related to Usernames and Guild Designations. Each user will either select a character name or allow the Service to automatically select a character name at random. Additionally&#44; users may form &#34;guilds&#34; and such guilds will be required to choose a name for the guild. When you choose a character name&#44; create a guild&#44; or otherwise create a label that can be seen by other players using the Game or the Service&#44; you must abide by the following guidelines as well as the rules of common decency. If Blizzard finds such a label to be offensive or improper&#44; it may&#44; in its sole and absolute discretion&#44; change the name&#44; remove the label and corresponding chat room&#44; and/or suspend or terminate your use of the Service. In particular&#44; you may not use any name&#58;

</p><br/><p>
C. Rules Related to Game Play. Game play is what World of Warcraft is all about&#44; and Blizzard strictly enforces the rules that govern game play. Blizzard considers most conduct to be part of the Game&#44; and not harassment&#44; so player&#45;killing the enemies of your race and/or alliance&#44; including gravestone and/or corpse camping&#44; is considered a part of the Game. Because the Game is a &#34;player vs. player&#34; game&#44; you should always remember to protect yourself in areas where the members of hostile races can attack you&#44; rather than contacting Blizzard&#39;s in&#45;game customer service representatives for help when you have been killed by an enemy of your race. Nonetheless&#44; certain acts go beyond what is &#34;fair&#34; and are considered serious violations of these Terms of Use. Those acts include&#44; but are not necessarily limited to&#44; the following&#58;
</p><br/><p>
(i) Using or exploiting errors in design&#44; features which have not been documented&#44; and/or &#34;program bugs&#34; to gain access that is otherwise not available&#44; or to obtain a competitive advantage over other players;
<br/>
(ii) Conduct prohibited by the EULA or elsewhere in these Terms of Use; and
<br/>
(iii) Anything that Blizzard considers contrary to the &#34;essence&#34; of the Game.
</p><br/><p>
10. Security of Login Information. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the Login Information&#44; and you will be responsible for all uses of the Login Information&#44; whether or not authorized by you. In the event that you become aware of or reasonably suspect any breach of security&#44; including without limitation any loss&#44; theft&#44; or unauthorized disclosure of the Login Information&#44; you must immediately notify Blizzard by emailing wowaccountadmin&#64;blizzard.com. 
</p><br/><p>

You agree that you have no right or title in or to any such content&#44; including without limitation the virtual goods or currency appearing or originating in the Game&#44; or any other attributes associated with the Account or stored on the Service. Blizzard does not recognize any purported transfers of virtual property executed outside of the Game&#44; or the purported sale&#44; gift or trade in the &#34;real world&#34; of anything that appears or originates in the Game. Accordingly&#44; you may not sell in&#45;game items or currency for &#34;real&#34; money&#44; or exchange those items or currency for value outside of the Game.
</p><br/><p>
12. Changes to the Terms of Use Agreement or the Game.

If any future changes to this Agreement are unacceptable to you or cause you to no longer be in compliance with this Agreement&#44; you must terminate&#44; and immediately stop using&#44; the Game and the Account. Your continued use of the Game following any revision to this Agreement constitutes your complete and irrevocable acceptance of any and all such changes. Blizzard may change&#44; modify&#44; suspend&#44; or discontinue any aspect of the Game at any time.

</p><br/><p>

The arbitration may be conducted in person&#44; through the submission of documents&#44; by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing&#44; but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law&#44; and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement&#44; you and Blizzard may litigate in court to compel arbitration&#44; stay proceeding pending arbitration&#44; or to confirm&#44; modify&#44; vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. 
</p><br/><p>
C. Restrictions. You and Blizzard agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between Blizzard and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law&#44; (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class&#45;action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

If the Act applies&#44; then notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement&#44; you may have rights or remedies as set out in the Act which may apply in addition to&#44; or&#44; to the extent that they are inconsistent&#44; instead of&#44; the rights or remedies set out in this Agreement. Those who choose to access the Service from locations outside of the United States&#44; Canada&#44; Australia&#44; Singapore&#44; or New Zealand do so on their own initiative contrary to the terms of this Agreement&#44; and are responsible for compliance with local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable.

G. Severability. You and Blizzard agree that if any portion Section 19 is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of 19(d))&#44; that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the Section shall be given full force and effect. If Section 19(d) is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor Blizzard will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of Section 19(d) found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of Los Angeles&#44; State of California&#44; United States of America&#44; and you and Blizzard agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

20. Miscellaneous. If any provision of this Agreement shall be unlawful&#44; void&#44; or for any reason unenforceable&#44; then that provision shall be deemed severable from this Agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. This Terms of Use Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between you and Blizzard concerning the Service&#44; and this Agreement supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreement&#44; either oral or written&#44; and any other communications with regard thereto between you and Blizzard; provided&#44; however that this Agreement is in addition to&#44; and does not replace or supplant&#44; the EULA. This Agreement may only be modified as set forth herein. The section headings used herein are for reference only and shall not be read to have any legal effect.
